        "content": "The Lazy Person's Guide to Machine Learning 🚀 🤖 Machine learning is a powerful tool for making predictions and extracting insights from data. However, building and evaluating machine learning models can be a time-consuming and tedious process, requiring expertise in programming, data preprocessing, and model selection. 😩 PyCaret is a Python library that aims to simplify and streamline the machine learning process by providing a high-level API for common machine learning tasks, such as data preprocessing, model training, and model interpretation. 🤗In this blog post, we will demonstrate the key features of PyCaret on the telecom_custom_churn dataset, a classic binary classification problem in the telecom industry. 📊Setting up PyCaret 🛠️The first step in using PyCaret is to install it using pip and import it into your Python environment. Once you have installed PyCaret, you can load the telecom_custom_churn(I chose this because i recently did some EDA on it here) dataset using the pycaret.datasets.get_data function and set up your PyCaret environment using the pycaret.classification.setup function. 🐍 The setup function performs automatic data preprocessing tasks such as missing value imputation, feature encoding, feature scaling, and feature selection, making it easy to prepare your data for machine learning. Here’s an example of how to set up your PyCaret environment:pip install pycaretfrom pycaret.datasets import get_datafrom pycaret.classification import setup,compare_modelsdata = get_data('telecom_customer_churn')clf = setup(data,target='Customer Status')best_model = compare_models()Comparing Models 🤔Once you have set up your PyCaret environment, you can train and evaluate several machine learning models using the pycaret.classification.compare_models function. This function trains and evaluates several models using cross-validation(default fold of 10) and provides a summary table of the performance metrics for each model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC. Based on this summary table, you can select the best-performing model for your task. 😎 Here’s an example of how to compare several classification models using PyCaret:best_model = pycaret.classification.compare_models()Creating &amp; Interpreting Models 🕵️‍♀️After selecting the best-performing model, you can use the pycaret.classification.interpret_model function to understand how the model is making predictions. This function generates several plots and charts that can help you understand the importance of different features in the model and how they are affecting the model’s predictions.The create_model function in PyCaret can create a wide range of machine learning models for different tasks. Here’s a list of some of the models you can create using create_model:  Linear Regression  Logistic Regression  Ridge Regression  Lasso Regression  Elastic Net  Least Angle Regression  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  Naive Bayes  Decision Tree  Random Forest  Extra Trees  Gradient Boosting  Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)  Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM)  CatBoostNote that the available models may depend on the specific PyCaret version and any additional packages you have installed. You can also customize the hyperparameters of each model using the tune_model function in PyCaret to optimize their performance on your specific dataset. Here’s an example of how to interpret a random forest classifier using PyCaret:rf_model = pycaret.classification.create_model('rf')pycaret.classification.interpret_model(rf_model)                  Saving and Deploying Models 💾Once you have trained and evaluated your machine learning model, you can save it using the pycaret.classification.save_model function and deploy it as a web service, API, or standalone application. PyCaret provides several deployment options, such as Flask, FastAPI, Streamlit, and REST API, making it easy to integrate your machine learning models into your applications.save_model(best_model,'model')Let’s see how to load the model and predict the outputLoading the modelimport picklewith open('model.pkl', 'rb') as f:    model = pickle.load(f)Loading the datafrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_scoreX = data.drop('Customer Status',axis=1)y = data['Customer Status']Preprocessing the dataimport pandas as pdX = pd.get_dummies(X,drop_first=True)y = pd.get_dummies(y,drop_first=True)X_train,X_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(X,y,test_size=0.2)X_train = X_train.fillna(0)X_test = X_test.fillna(0)model.fit(X_train,y_train)model.score(X_test,y_test)And we got the score as 0.950319375443577 ! which is not the highest but yea it works !Conclusion 🎉Now that you know the basics of PyCaret, you can start exploring its advanced features and use cases. With PyCaret, you can take your machine learning skills to the next level and tackle complex problems with confidence.So what are you waiting for? Go ahead and try out PyCaret on your own datasets, and let us know how it goes!Happy modeling! 🚀👨‍💻🔬References 📚  PyCaret Documentation",

        "content": "Handcalcs: The Ultimate Tool for Simplifying Your Jupyter NotebooksHave you become weary of composing intricate equations in LaTeX within your Jupyter notebooks? Do you wish there was a less complicated way to clearly and concisely communicate your calculations and formulae? You are in luck if so! With the help of the robust Python module Handcalcs, you can speed up your computations and improve the appearance of your Jupyter notebooks. In this blog post, we’ll look at the advantages of utilising Handcalcs and how it can help you complete data analysis jobs faster and with less effort. So let’s get started and learn how Handcalcs can make your life as a data scientist easier!First Things First: What is Handcalcs?Handcalcs is a library to render Python calculation code automatically in Latex, but in a manner that mimics how one might format their calculation if it were written with a pencil: write the symbolic formula, followed by numeric substitutions, and then the result.Because handcalcs shows the numeric substitution, the calculations become significantly easier to check and verify by hand.PS : Copied from here 😅Installaionpip install handcalcsImporting Handcalcsfrom handcalcs import handcalcHow it Works?In order to extract the math expressions from the input and analyse the Python code, Handcalcs first employs a parser. The SymPy library, a Python library for symbolic mathematics, serves as the foundation for this parser.The retrieved mathematical expressions are then transformed by Handcalcs into SymPy expressions, which are symbolic expressions that represent mathematical formulas in a format that is simple to use and understand.Handcalcs applies a set of formatting guidelines to transform the math expressions from SymPy expressions into LaTeX style. These guidelines include arranging the equations for easier reading, providing annotations, units, and variable descriptions, as well as formatting the math expressions using LaTeX syntax.The prepared equations are then displayed in a LaTeX output that Handcalcs produces. The package includes built-in LaTeX rendering capabilities that may be used to show this output in a Jupyter notebook or copy it and paste it into a LaTeX document.How to Use Handcalcs?Default Renderimport handcalcs.renderfrom math import sqrt%%rendera = 1b = -31/3c = 3Symbolic Render%%render symbolicx_pos = -b + sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c) / (2*a) -b + sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)/(2*a)This will give only the symbolic output without valuesTruncating OutputWe can also add Override tags which will truncate the output which visually looks small like this:%%render paramsa = 1b = -31/3c = 3%%render params 6 a = 1b = -31/3c = 3This will truncate the output%%render # matrix calulationsA = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]B = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]C = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]#adding matricesX = [[A[i][j] + B[i][j] for j in range(len(A[0]))] for i in range(len(A))]#multiplying matricesY = [[sum(a*b for a,b in zip(A_row,B_col)) for B_col in zip(*B)] for A_row in A]```py&lt;img align=\"center\" src=\"/assets/img/Handcalcs/out3.png\"&gt;We can force a render to be long(rendering in a multiple line) or short(rendering in a single line) by using the following tags:```py%%render longx_pos = -b + sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c) / (2*a) -b + sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)/(2*a)%%render shortx_pos = -b + sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c) / (2*a) -b + sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)/(2*a)LATEX RenderWe can also get the LATEX equivalent of the output by using the following tag:%%texx_pos = -b + sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c) / (2*a) -b + sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)/(2*a)Subscripting and SuperscriptingWe can go on adding subscripts using _ and superscripts using ** like this:%%render#subscripting look at x_posx_pos = -b + sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c) / (2*a) -b + sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)/(2*a)%%render#subperscipting , look at bx_pos = b**2 - 4*a*cGreek SymbolsThey have a support for a list of greek symbols :It supports for comment rendering too!%%render short params 6x_pos = -b + sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c) / (2*a) -b + sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)/(2*a) #commentsConditional Rendering%%render #conditional statementsx = 1if x &gt; 0: b = 2*xelif x &lt; 0: b=yOverall this is a good package to use for rendering your calculations in a more readable format. It is a good alternative to using LaTeX in your Jupyter notebooks. It is also a good package to use for teaching students as it makes the calculations more readable and understandable.Their GitHub repo is here",

        "content": "Making MandelBrot-Set with Excel.    Yes, that is click-bait … This is what I thought when my professor said you will be making Mandelbrot set in Excel !But considering the computing power of my laptop and Excel, I was convinced. Ps: I did it on my friend’s laptop as Linux doesn’t have any good Excel alternative ( fact 1 - I use Manjaro as my daily Driver ( except for gaming duh ) while writing this blog)We were able to pull off this Mandelbrot in excel using 10 Iterations and going more than this makes your system awestruck .. it freezes.This was the load on the CPU when I tried to load the Excel file. (fact 2 The file size is ~60 MB)These are not some machine codes(not with decimals of course) it is the computation that happens based on the formula which we give in the table.When all the computations are working well, you will get this as the result!    Not bad for an Excel Computation. Though we cannot zoom into it and get a mind-gaze experience like this, this still is good for me at least.The ComputationThe Mandelbrot set is a mathematical set of points that are defined using a complex number system. The math behind it involves iterating a complex function, which is defined as follows:\\[f(z) = z^2 + c\\]Where $z$ is a complex number and $c$ is a constant. The function is iterated over and over again, with the result of the previous iteration being used as the input for the next iteration. The iteration stops when the absolute value of the result is greater than 2, or when the iteration count reaches a maximum value. The number of iterations it takes for the absolute value to exceed 2 is the number of times the point is in the Mandelbrot set.In other words, the Mandelbrot set is the set of all complex numbers “c” for which the sequence of numbers f(0), f(f(0)), f(f(f(0))), etc. remains bounded in magnitude. This means that the magnitude of the numbers in the sequence never grows larger than a certain value (which is usually set to 2).The Mandelbrot set can be visualized by plotting the complex number “c” on a complex plane and coloring the points according to whether or not the corresponding sequence remains bounded. This produces a beautiful and intricate pattern, which has been studied extensively by mathematicians.Iterating manually using ExcelI took numbers from -2 to +2 with a step size of 0.01 for rows and columns        Then we use the data table from excel to fill up those rows and columns which get formed by the above 2 images.    We use the cells B1 and C1 in the Data Analysis tool        It would look like this in the first iteration.        Use this formula for=IMSUM(IMPRODUCT(B3,B3),B3)    The second iteration will look like this    Now make a new sheet and put this formula at A1=IMABS(Sheet8!B3615)And reduce the height and width of cells to make the Mandelbrot visible! It will be without colors, you can change the style of the sheet. Just select all the cells and make a sheet color format and set if the cell value &lt; 2 color it with black.    When everything goes well , the final sheet after zooming out should look like :    That’s it ! You made fractal using Excel !",

        "content": "Journey of OS Hoping    Like all teenagers, I was using Windows for Gaming (mostly) and some coding (school-level stuff). When Covid happened, during lockdown started reading about the latest tech news. And I was amazed to see how Linux is growing. And I was like “I should try it”. And I did. And I was amazed. Amazed by the customization, performance, community, software, security, privacy, and stability(which I broke many times). I was amazed by the speed and looks. I was amazed by everything. I was using it as a VM and I joined my undergrad. My friend asked me to dual-boot it. Started with Zorin. Was using it for college purposes. Wasn’t into customization at that time. Had all my workspaces set up [a mini actual developer feeling :)]. After a while, my friend again asked me to use Kubuntu, a KDE-based distro. I was like “why not”. He said you can do a lot of customization, I was like YESS I’m in! At first, it felt a little weird without the Zorin Vibe. And Guess what I customized it in such a way that it felt like Zorin (with extra additions). This was the time when I started liking the bar which exists on almost all distros.This new attraction of the bar made me customize the bar so much that all the necessary controls are in the bar which I was able to access easily. KDE gave so many widgets that allow people to have some stuff that you need to manually code which will take lots of trials and run!After using KDE for quite a long time ~ 7 months, one fine day when I did a system update, the package databases weren’t syncing. I was not able to install anything new. The widgets stopped working and I was pissed off. Then again my friend asked me to use Manjaro, an arch-based distro with GDM. At first, I was like, meh it looks like normal Ubuntu I don’t like it. And I was too attached to KDE that I wanted that workflow as badly as possible. And he sent me the Gnome customizations. And again I fell for it. Lots of Reddit forums and youtube videos. I started experimenting with it. Now the workflow I have is such that with the keybindings only I can move around the system (unless you see configs).The current shell theme is OtisLegacy Applications theme is KriptonThe icon theme is PapirusUsing Gnome-extensions for the top bar and the dock.The terminal is Gnome-terminal with the zsh. Using blur-my-shell extension to get transparent background and blur it .    And as my course is focused on AI ML installed the GPU related stuff.    My Github repo here where mostly college stuff and coding happens 😊.That My friend repo here.That’s a wrap ! I would strongly suggest whoever reads this to start using Linux (but don’t just OS hop too much ) , try out different stuff , break - fix - repeat .I have always wanted to make Linux Personal, so learning to do all these customization . Soon will be moving to Arch and will update this when some good stuff happens . 😊    ",
